						<h2>Synopsis</h2>
						The drama takes place in 19th century Britain. It centers on the aristocratic Bridgerton family. The widow
						Violet, Dowager Viscountess Bridgerton is mother to eight children: her four sons, Anthony, Benedict, Colin,
						and Gregory; and her four daughters, Daphne, Eloise, Francesca, and Hyacinth. (In birth order, their names
						are also alphabetical.) Also featured are their gaudy neighbors, the Featheringtons: Portia, Lady
						Featherington; her husband the Baron; and their three daughters, Philippa, Prudence and Penelope; as well as
						their mysterious cousin Marina Thompson. Each episode includes narration by actress Julie Andrews, who
						voices the anonymous and ever-scandalous newsletter columnist known as Lady Whistledown. As eldest daughter
						Daphne Bridgerton enters her first season with Queen Charlotte's favor, she meets Simon Basset, Duke of
						Hastings and best friend of her eldest brother, Anthony. Despite being encouraged by his mentor, Lady
						Danbury, the Duke is determined not to marry and plots with Daphne to secure his bachelordom and her a
						suitable marriage.
